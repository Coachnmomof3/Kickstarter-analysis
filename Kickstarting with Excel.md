# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
To show how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
December was not the best to launch month.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Cancelations did not take place in this area. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The Goal range did not come over in the same order as the data table that was created for the Outcomes based on Goals Chart.  I had to manually sort them.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
May did well and Decemer did not


- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
Goals set at less than 1000 had the higher success rate.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
The number of successful concerning the Goal does not make for the best visualization.  Majority of the success is captured within the 1000 to 4999 range. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
Lines with Markers and Stacked Lines with Markers.
